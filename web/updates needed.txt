Updates to keezer pending:

Arduino:
	Allow temperature to be changed externally via Serial
	Add error handling (needs to be robust)
	Use float to make decisions instead of integer
	Make limits adaptive (best way?)

Web:
	Allow temperature update
	Make more interactive:
		Zoom
		Tooltips
		Calculations

Hardware/physical:
	Solder together real model, put in box
	Find proper final mount for temperature sensor
	Steel/aluminum tube, food safe glue (silicon sealant, stainless steal)
