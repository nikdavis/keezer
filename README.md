## Nik's chest freezer (KEEZER) project

This project includes
- Schematics, board file
- MCU code (Arduino based)
- Archaic (likely-broken) web interface

It is a snapshot of where I left this project. I'm currently looking for the schematic/board files across my HDDs. I don't recall if they were created with EAGLE or Altium. To be remembered...
